**Last Updated:** May 8, 2025

## 3. Information Fusion Handles

Fusion is designed to minimize direct collection of personal data. However, to provide its services, Fusion handles the following types of information:

*   **Information for Third-Party Service Integration:**
    *   To connect with services like Trakt, TMDB, MDBList, or OpenRouter at the user's request, Fusion may require API keys or authentication tokens. This information is provided by the user.
    *   **Storage:** Trakt tokens are stored securely in the device's Keychain. API keys for TMDB, MDBList, and OpenRouter are stored in UserDefaults on the user's device.
*   **iCloud Sync Data:**
    *   If the user enables iCloud Sync, certain app settings and data (e.g., Trakt catalog lists, addon configurations, general preferences) are synced via the user's private iCloud account using `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`. This data is subject to Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policies. Fusion does not directly access or control the data stored in the user's iCloud account beyond facilitating the sync.
*   **Addon-Related Information:**
    *   When users install and use addons from user-provided URLs, they are directing Fusion to interact with the addon's specified endpoint. Fusion transmits identifiers (like IMDB or TMDB IDs) and user-initiated queries (like search terms or filter selections) to these endpoints as instructed by the user's choice of addon and configuration.
*   **Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**
    *   Fusion may handle non-personally identifiable information related to app configuration and settings, stored locally or synced via iCloud as per user choice.

Fusion **does not** collect or transmit user data for its own analytics, tracking, or advertising purposes.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

Fusion processes personal data under the following legal bases as required by GDPR Article 6:

### a) Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)):
* For storing and processing third-party API keys and authentication tokens that users explicitly provide
* For enabling iCloud syncing when users activate this feature
* For processing addon-related information when users choose to install specific addons

### b) Contract Performance (Art. 6(1)(b)):
* For sending necessary data to third-party services (Trakt, TMDB, MDBList, OpenRouter) to fulfill the app's core functionality as requested by the user
* For processing user queries and configuration preferences to deliver the expected app experience

### c) Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f)):
* For storing basic app configuration data locally to maintain app functionality
* For implementing security measures to protect user credentials
   
Our legitimate interests are balanced against user privacy rights and are limited to what's necessary for the app's proper functioning. These interests do not override the fundamental rights or interests of users.

## 5. How Fusion Uses Information

*   **To Provide App Functionality:** Information is used to enable features like connecting to third-party services, displaying content through addons, and syncing settings across devices (if iCloud is enabled).
*   **Local Storage:** API keys and authentication data are stored locally as described above to allow persistent connections to third-party services without requiring re-authentication each time.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Fusion does not share personal information with its developers or any external third parties, except as described below, typically at the user's direction:

*   **Third-Party Services (User-Initiated):** When a user connects Fusion to services like Trakt, TMDB, MDBList, or OpenRouter, the user is directing Fusion to transmit the necessary data (API keys, requests) to these services as required for their operation. Users should review the privacy policies of these third-party services.
*   **Addons (User-Initiated):** When a user installs an addon from a user-provided URL, the user is directing Fusion to make requests to the addon's specified endpoint. This involves sending necessary query data as per the addon's design and the user's interaction. Users should be aware that addons are provided by third parties. It is the user's responsibility to understand the source of the addon and to review any privacy information provided by the addon developer. The security and privacy practices of addon endpoints are the responsibility of the addon provider, and by using an addon, the user accepts these terms.
*   **Apple iCloud (User-Initiated):** If iCloud sync is enabled by the user, data is managed by Apple's iCloud service. Fusion does not control this data.
*   **Legal Requirements:** Fusion may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend the rights or property of Fusion, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App or the public.

## 7. Data Retention

*   API keys and authentication tokens for third-party services are stored on the user's device until the user removes them or uninstalls the app.
*   Data synced via iCloud is subject to Apple's data retention policies and user management of their iCloud storage.
*   Fusion does not maintain its own servers storing user personal data.

## 8. User Rights

Users have certain rights regarding their personal data. Subject to local data protection laws, these may include:

*   **Right to Access:** The right to request copies of personal data Fusion holds about the user (primarily locally stored API keys/tokens, which the user can view/manage in the app).
*   **Right to Rectification:** The right to request correction of inaccurate personal data.
*   **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** The right to request erasure of personal data (e.g., by removing API keys from the app, which deletes them from local storage).
*   **Right to Restrict Processing.**
*   **Right to Data Portability.**
*   **Right to Object to Processing.**
*   **Right to Withdraw Consent:** Where processing is based on consent, the user can withdraw it at any time (e.g., by disabling iCloud sync, disconnecting a service, or uninstalling an addon).

To exercise these rights, users can typically manage data directly within Fusion's settings or by contacting Fusion support at diffusiocreatio@gmail.com.

## 9. Data Security

Fusion takes reasonable measures to protect the information handled by the app:

*   Trakt tokens are stored in the device's Keychain.
*   Connections to Trakt.tv and MDBList.com are made over HTTPS. Addon endpoints are the responsibility of the addon provider.
*   Fusion does not store user passwords directly. Authentication with third-party services is typically handled via tokens.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Users are also responsible for maintaining the security of their devices and their credentials for third-party services and iCloud.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Fusion itself does not transfer data internationally. User-initiated connections to third-party services or addons may involve international data transfers as per those services' policies.

## 11. Children's Privacy

Fusion is not intended for use by children. Fusion does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact Fusion support.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Fusion may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any significant changes. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
